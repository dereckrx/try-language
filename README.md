## Try Language!

A repo for testing out languages. 

Includes module files for use (syntax highlighting, library imports) in intelliJ, and some linter configs.

Most contain a version of "Hello World" that can be run as a single file from the command line. Instructions to run it can be found at the top of the file.

Some additional files have been added for languages with more complicated setups such as Elm ;)
